 idk I don't have a proper name for this
 

## My small TODO list that I will definitely remember to update accordingly
 - [ ] add shooting
 - [ ] add different weapons along with shooting
 - [ ] implement mouse and keyboard controls
 - [ ] move to tilemap system
 - [ ] pixel graphics? could make everything easier
 - [ ] add some stuff to shoot at
 - [ ] platformer or shooter? why not both?
 - [ ] learn HLSL
 - [ ] level editor, maybe
